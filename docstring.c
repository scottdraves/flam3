"the flam3-genome program creates random parameter files. it also mutates,\n"
"rotates, and interpolates existing parameter files.  for example to\n"
"create 10 wholly new control points and render them at normal quality:\n"
"\n"
"    env template=vidres.flam3 repeat=10 flam3-genome > new.flam3\n"
"    flam3-render < new.flam3\n"

"if you left out the \"template=vidres.flam3\" part then the size,\n"

"Mutation is done by giving an input flame file to alter:\n"

"    env template=vidres.flam3 flam3-genome > parent.flam3\n"
"    env prefix=parent. flam3-render < parent.flam3\n"

"flam3-genome has 3 ways to produce parameter files for animation in\n"
"the style of electric sheep.  the highest level and most useful from\n"
"the command line is the sequence method.  it takes a collection of\n"
"control points and makes an animation that has each flame do fractal\n"
"rotation for 360 degrees, then make a smooth transition to the next.\n"
"for example:\n"
"\n"
"    env sequence=test.flam3 nframes=20 flam3-genome > seq.flam3\n"
"    flam3-animate < seq.flam3\n"
"\n"
"creates and renders a 60 frame animation.  there are two flames in\n"
"test.flam3, so the animation consists three stags: the first one\n"
"rotating, then a transition, then the second one rotating.  each stage\n"
"has 20 frames as specified on the command line.  if you want to\n"
"render only some fraction of a whole animation file, specify the begin\n"
"and end times:\n"
"\n"
"    env begin=20 end=40 flam3-animate < seq.flam3\n"
"\n"
"the other two methods are harder to use becaues they produce files that\n"
"are only good for one frame of animation.  the output consists of 3\n"
"control points, one for the time requested, one before and one after.\n"
"that allows proper motion blur.  for example:\n"
"\n"
"    env template=vidres.flam3 flam3-genome > rotme.flam3\n"
"    env rotate=rotme.flam3 frame=10 nframes=20 flam3-genome > rot10.flam3\n"
"    env frame=10 flam3-animate < rot10.flam3\n"
"\n"
"the file rot10.flam3 specifies the animation for just one frame, in\n"
"this case 10 out of 20 frames in the complete animation.  C1\n"
"continuous electric sheep genetic crossfades are created like this:\n"
"\n"
"    env inter=test.flam3 frame=10 nframes=20 flam3-genome > inter10.flam3\n"
"    env frame=10 flam3-animate < inter10.flam3\n"
